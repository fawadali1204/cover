Example # 1:
"Hello,

I understand you're looking for a google ads freelancer for the dental space in the UK - this popped out to me as a previous client of mine was dental beauty (franchise mainly in london/south east). We managed to drive great results for them on Facebook for their invisalign campaign, so confident I can use that experience to help advise you on how to best improve your current campaign set up.

Is this dental client a single practice or a franchise business? How is the google account structure set up?

Happy to jump on a call and discuss further.

Thanks,
Archy"

Example # 2
"Hello !

I understand you're looking for a paid search freelancer to help support your client account - this is something I can help with as I've got 5+ years experience in the search space. I have also run search activity for a B2B client (capsule) so I'm confident I can help you out. It's also great to hear that you already do UX and CRO as this will help support efforts on PPC.

Happy to take a look at the account and analyse why there's been a sudden change in performance, and report back to you with suggestions for change to resolve this. This would involve me getting read-only access to google ads and analytics alongside a site/tagging change log to try and map out where performance has dropped - I can then present my findings back to you in a deck for you to take away or for me to action.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss further on a call.

Thanks,
Archy"
